 abstract = {Even in the absence of unmeasured confounding factors or model misspecification, standard methods for estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival are biased when (a) there exists a time-dependent risk factor for survival that also predicts subsequent treatment, and (b) past treatment history predicts subsequent risk factor level. In contrast, methods based on marginal structural models (MSMs) can provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. MSMs are a new class of causal models whose parameters are estimated using a new class of estimators-inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators. We use a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the joint effect of zidovudine (AZT) and prophylaxis therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on the survival of HIV-positive men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an observational study of homosexual men. We obtained an estimated causal mortality rate (hazard) ratio of .67 (conservative 95% confidence interval .46-.98) for AZT and of 1.14 (.79, 1.64) for prophylaxis therapy. These estimates will be consistent for the true causal rate ratios when the functional forms chosen for our models are correct and data have been obtained on all time-independent and time-dependent covariates that predict both subsequent treatment and mortality.},

In this paper, we derive a new class of double-robust estimators for the parameters of regression models with incomplete cross-sectional or longitudinal data, and of marginal structural mean models for cross-sectional data with similar efficiency properties.

 abstract = {In assessing the efficacy of a time-varying treatment structural nested models (SNMs) are useful in dealing with confounding by variables affected by earlier treatments. These models often consider treatment allocation and repeated measures at the individual level. We extend SNMMs to clustered observations with time-varying confounding and treatments. We demonstrate how to formulate models with both cluster- and unit-level treatments and show how to derive semiparametric estimators of parameters in such models. For unit-level treatments, we consider interference, namely the effect of treatment on outcomes in other units of the same cluster. The properties of estimators are evaluated through simulations and compared with the conventional GEE regression method for clustered outcomes. To illustrate our method, we use data from the treatment arm of a glaucoma clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of two commonly used ocular hypertension medications.},

Intermediate causal effects that describe time-varying causal effects of treatment conditional on past covariate history are introduced and considered as part of Robins' structural nested mean model. Two estimators of the intermediate causal effects, and their standard errors, are presented and discussed: The first is a proposed two-stage regression estimator. The second is Robins' G-estimator. The results of a small simulation study that begins to shed light on the small versus large sample performance of the estimators, and on the bias-variance trade-off between the two estimators are presented. The methodology is illustrated using longitudinal data from a depression study.},

A key benefit of causal ML is that it allows for estimating individualized treatment effects, so that clinical decision-making can be personalized to individual patient profiles. Causal ML can be used in combination with both clinical trial data and real-world data, such as clinical registries and electronic health records, but caution is needed to avoid biased or incorrect predictions. In this Perspective, we discuss the benefits of causal ML (relative to traditional statistical or ML approaches) and outline the key components and steps.

  abstract = 	 {Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data is a central problem in many domains. Because counterfactual data is inaccessible, the problem differs fundamentally from supervised learning, and entails a more complex set of modeling choices. Despite a variety of recently proposed algorithmic solutions, a principled guideline for building estimators of treatment effects using machine learning algorithms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide such a guideline by characterizing the fundamental limits of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, and establishing conditions under which these limits can be achieved. Our analysis reveals that the relative importance of the different aspects of observational data vary with the sample size. For instance, we show that selection bias matters only in small-sample regimes, whereas with a large sample size, the way an algorithm models the control and treated outcomes is what bottlenecks its performance. Guided by our analysis, we build a practical algorithm for estimating treatment effects using a non-stationary Gaussian processes with doubly-robust hyperparameters. Using a standard semi-synthetic simulation setup, we show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art, and that the behavior of existing algorithms conforms with our analysis.}

	abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.},

 abstract = {[In the portion of the paper translated here, Neyman introduces a model for the analysis of field experiments conducted for the purpose of comparing a number of crop varieties, which makes use of a double-indexed array of unknown potential yields, one index corresponding to varieties and the other to plots. The yield corresponding to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula for the variance of the difference between the averages of the observed yields of two varieties. This variance involves the variance over all plots of the potential yields and the correlation coefficient r between the potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot. Since it is impossible to estimate r directly, Neyman advises taking r = 1, observing that in practice this may lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation, when comparing two variety means.]},

 abstract = {Predicated on the increasing abundance of electronic health records, we investi- gate the problem of inferring individualized treatment effects using observational data. Stemming from the potential outcomes model, we propose a novel multi- task learning framework in which factual and counterfactual outcomes are mod- eled as the outputs of a function in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vvRKHS). We develop a nonparametric Bayesian method for learning the treatment effects using a multi-task Gaussian process (GP) with a linear coregion- alization kernel as a prior over the vvRKHS. The Bayesian approach allows us to compute individualized measures of confidence in our estimates via pointwise credible intervals, which are crucial for realizing the full potential of precision medicine. The impact of selection bias is alleviated via a risk-based empirical Bayes method for adapting the multi-task GP prior, which jointly minimizes the empirical error in factual outcomes and the uncertainty in (unobserved) counter- factual outcomes. We conduct experiments on observational datasets for an inter- ventional social program applied to premature infants, and a left ventricular assist device applied to cardiac patients wait-listed for a heart transplant. In both experi- ments, we show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

 abstract = {In observational studies with exposures or treatments that vary over time, standard approaches for adjustment of confounding are biased when there exist time-dependent confounders that are also affected by previous treatment. This paper introduces marginal structural models, a new class of causal models that allow for improved adjustment of confounding in those situations. The parameters of a marginal structural model can be consistently estimated using a new class of estimators, the inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators.},

@article{Orellana.2010,
 abstract = {Dynamic treatment regimes are set rules for sequential decision making based on patient covariate history. Observational studies are well suited for the investigation of the effects of dynamic treatment regimes because of the variability in treatment decisions found in them. This variability exists because different physicians make different decisions in the face of similar patient histories. In this article we describe an approach to estimate the optimal dynamic treatment regime among a set of enforceable regimes. This set is comprised by regimes defined by simple rules based on a subset of past information. The regimes in the set are indexed by a Euclidean vector. The optimal regime is the one that maximizes the expected counterfactual utility over all regimes in the set. We discuss assumptions under which it is possible to identify the optimal regime from observational longitudinal data. Murphy et al. (2001) developed efficient augmented inverse probability weighted estimators of the expected utility of one fixed regime. Our methods are based on an extension of the marginal structural mean model of Robins (1998, 1999) which incorporate the estimation ideas of Murphy et al. (2001). Our models, which we call dynamic regime marginal structural mean models, are specially suitable for estimating the optimal treatment regime in a moderately small class of enforceable regimes of interest. We consider both parametric and semiparametric dynamic regime marginal structural models. We discuss locally efficient, double-robust estimation of the model parameters and of the index of the optimal treatment regime in the set. In a companion paper in this issue of the journal we provide proofs of the main results.},

@article{Robins.1994,
 abstract = {In a randomized trial designed to study the effect of a treatment of interest on the evolution of the mean of a time-dependent outcome variable, subjects are assigned to a treatment regime, or, equivalently, a treatment protocol. Unfortunately, subjects often fail to comply with their assigned regime. From a public health point of view, the causal parameter of interest will often be a function of the treatment differences that would have been observed hadcontrary to fact, all subjects remained on protocol. This paper considers the identification and estimation of these treatment differences based on a new class of structural models, the multivariate structural nested mean models, when reliable estimates of each subject's actual treatment are available. Estimates of ?actual treatment? might, for example, be obtained by measuring the amount of ?active drug? in the subject's blood or urine at each follow-up visit or by pill counting techniques. In addition, we discuss a natural extension of our methods to observational studies.},

 abstract = {[We provide sufficient conditions for estimating from longitudinal data the causal effect of a time-dependent exposure or treatment on the marginal probability of response for a dichotomous outcome. We then show how one can estimate this effect under these conditions using the g-computation algorithm of Robins. We also derive the conditions under which some current approaches to the analysis of longitudinal data, such as the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach of Zeger and Liang, the feedback model techniques of Liang and Zeger, and within-subject conditional methods, can provide valid tests and estimates of causal effects. We use our methods to estimate the causal effect of maternal stress on the marginal probability of a child's illness from the Mothers' Stress and Children's Morbidity data and compare our results with those previously obtained by Zeger and Liang using a GEE approach.]},

@article{Petersen.2014,
 abstract = {The practice of epidemiology requires asking causal questions. Formal frameworks for causal inference developed over the past decades have the potential to improve the rigor of this process. However, the appropriate role for formal causal thinking in applied epidemiology remains a matter of debate. We argue that a formal causal framework can help in designing a statistical analysis that comes as close as possible to answering the motivating causal question, while making clear what assumptions are required to endow the resulting estimates with a causal interpretation. A systematic approach for the integration of causal modeling with statistical estimation is presented. We highlight some common points of confusion that occur when causal modeling techniques are applied in practice and provide a broad overview on the types of questions that a causal framework can help to address. Our aims are to argue for the utility of formal causal thinking, to clarify what causal models can and cannot do, and to provide an accessible introduction to the flexible and powerful tools provided by causal models.},

isbn = {0262037319},

abstract = {A concise and self-contained introduction to causal inference, increasingly important in data science and machine learning. The mathematization of causality is a relatively recent development, and has become increasingly important in data science and machine learning. This book offers a self-contained and concise introduction to causal models and how to learn them from data. After explaining the need for causal models and discussing some of the principles underlying causal inference, the book teaches readers how to use causal models: how to compute intervention distributions, how to infer causal models from observational and interventional data, and how causal ideas could be exploited for classical machine learning problems. All of these topics are discussed first in terms of two variables and then in the more general multivariate case. The bivariate case turns out to be a particularly hard problem for causal learning because there are no conditional independences as used by classical methods for solving multivariate cases. The authors consider analyzing statistical asymmetries between cause and effect to be highly instructive, and they report on their decade of intensive research into this problem. The book is accessible to readers with a background in machine learning or statistics, and can be used in graduate courses or as a reference for researchers. The text includes code snippets that can be copied and pasted, exercises, and an appendix with a summary of the most important technical concepts.}
